## Build Instructions

- Click on the link below to get to the repository for the GreenTrax application.
    - [GreenTrax Github](https://github.com/ddc-java-14/greentrax)
- Once the website has pulled up look for the green Code button about 1/4 of the page down.
- Click on this and ensure that SSH is selected. Click the copy button near the end of the VCS address.
- In Intelli-J or your preferred IDE select open from VCS Source and paste the address which will open the application.
- Once the app is running you will be able to select the Google Sign-In button and follow the steps to login.
- Inside the app the only functioning button at this time is the "My Account" button in the upper left-hand corner.
- Selecting the "My Account" button will take you to a budget fragment which will allow you to select a spending type and then enter an amount along with an optional note.
    - At this point the saved data is being seen in the database but not yet able to display to the user.
- From this budget fragment we can navigate back to the home screen and selecting the menu icon in the upper right- hand corner will allow a user to sign-out.
